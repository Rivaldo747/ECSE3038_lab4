# ECSE3038_lab4
the aim of the lab exercise was to become familiar with using the ESP32. 
It was also important for us to understand API and how it works. 
Parsing the JSON response to extract the LED states, and using the digitalWrite() function to set the LED states was done in the circuit.
this lab in its entirety really created the opportunity to use a device while programming which was quite impressive.
